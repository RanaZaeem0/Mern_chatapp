Backend Project
This project is a backend server built with TypeScript, using Express for the web framework, Socket.IO for real-time communication, MongoDB as the database, and Node.js as the runtime. It also incorporates password hashing for security, CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment, and containerization using Docker and Docker Compose.

Features
Real-Time Communication with Socket.IO.
MongoDB for data storage.
Password Hashing for secure authentication.
CI/CD for continuous integration and delivery.
Dockerized application for easy deployment and environment consistency.

Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v16 or higher)
MongoDB (locally or via MongoDB Atlas)
Docker and Docker Compose (if using containerized setup)
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backend-project.git
cd backend-project
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure environment variables:

Copy the .env.example to .env and configure the environment variables, including MongoDB URI and JWT secret.

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Run the server:

For development:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the server with hot-reloading (via ts-node-dev).

For production:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
npm start
Usage
API Endpoints
POST /login: Authenticate users (Password is hashed and stored securely).
GET /users: Retrieve all users from the database.
POST /message: Send a real-time message to connected users via Socket.IO.
Docker Setup
Docker
Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t backend-project .
Run the container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 3000:3000 backend-project
This will start the application inside a Docker container, exposing port 3000.

Docker Compose
Start the project with Docker Compose:

Make sure Docker Compose is installed, then run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
This will automatically build the image and start the containers for both the backend and MongoDB.

Stop the containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
CI/CD Integration
Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)
This project uses a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment. The pipeline includes:

GitHub Actions for running tests, linting, and building the application.
Automated deployment to your server or cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
Check the .github/workflows directory for CI configuration files.
